# Portfolio and Interactive Resume

I needed a portfolio but as a junior web developer I didn't have much to put in a portfolio. After a little research I found that some people add an interactive resume to their portfolios, so this is mine.

## Dependencies

- react-dom
- react-scripts
- Styled Components

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
